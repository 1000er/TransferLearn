# TransferLearn
Pretrained MobileNet Model is used to obtain features from input images. 

With very few images (2-3) of each desired class, feartures are extracted with MobileNet model and are fed to KNN for clustering.

Custom Classes are One, Two, Three, Four and no action, which are represented using fingers of hand.
